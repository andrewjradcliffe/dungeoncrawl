# It's a text-based dungeon crawler!



## Getting started

Starting from the project root, build it:

``` shell
cargo build    # a release build is pointless at time of writing
```

Then, play
``` shell
./target/debug/play
```

### Need a copy?
``` shell
git clone https://github.com/andrewjradcliffe/dungeoncrawl.git
cd dungeoncrawl
```
